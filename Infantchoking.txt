Child choking

Symptoms 
	• Bluish skin colour
	• Difficulty breathing - ribs and chest pull inward
	• Loss of consciousness if blockage is not cleared
	• Inability to cry or make much sound
	• Weak, ineffective coughing
	• Soft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling
Do NOT perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway.
If your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps:
	1. Lay the infant face down, along your forearm. Use your thigh or lap for support. Hold the infant's chest in your hand and hold the jaw with your fingers. Point the infant's head downward, lower than the body.
	2. Give up to 5 quick, forceful blows between the infant's shoulder blades. Use the palm of your free hand.
If the object does not come out of the airway after 5 blows:
	1. Turn the infant face-up. Use your thigh or lap for support. Support the head.
	2. Place 2 fingers on the middle of his breastbone just below the nipples.
	3. Give up to 5 quick thrusts down, compressing the chest 1/3 to 1/2 the depth of the chest.
	4. Continue 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or the infant loses alertness (becomes unconscious).
IF THE INFANT LOSES ALERTNESS
If the child becomes unresponsive, stops breathing, or turns blue:
	• Shout for help.
	• Give infant CPR. Call 911 after 1 minute of CPR.
	• If you can see the object blocking the airway, try to remove it with your finger. Try to remove an object only if you can see it.

Infant CPR
	• Compression: Begin CPR by laying your baby down on a firm, flat surface. Do not spend time trying to find a pulse. Place your two fingers on the breastbone, just below the nipple line. Give your baby 30 quick chest compressions (push fast), pressing hard enough so their chest moves approximately 4 cm (1.5 inches) down (push hard).
Count out loud. You should deliver about 100-120 compressions a minute. Wait for the chest to come all the way back to its initial position between compressions. This will get the blood flowing to your baby's brain and other vital organs
	• Rescue breaths: After the first 30 chest compressions, place the palm of your hand on your baby’s forehead. Place two fingers on the hard, bony tip of their chin and gently tilt their head back. This will open the airway.Place your mouth over your baby's nose and mouth, forming a tight seal, and give two breaths. Each breath should be just enough to make your baby’s chest rise and should be no more than one second in length. If your baby’s chest does not rise, reposition their head, form a tighter seal, and try again.
	• Repeat: Give cycles of 30 chest compressions and two breaths during two minutes and repeat until the ambulance arrives or your baby starts breathing again.
	• Recovery position: Once your baby has recovered and started breathing again on their own, your baby may vomit and find it difficult to breathe. Simply put your baby in the recovery position: Their chin should point slightly away from the chest and their face should rest on the surface on which the baby is laying. Make sure nothing is blocking or covering your baby's mouth and nose. The recovery position will help keep your baby’s airway open.
