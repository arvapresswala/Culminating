Choking 

Choking occurs when a foreign object becomes lodged in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air.

Symptoms 
	• Inability to talk
	• Difficulty breathing or noisy breathing
	• Inability to cough forcefully
	• Skin, lips and nails turning blue or dusky
	• Loss of consciousness

Treatment
Ask someone to call 911
	• Give 5 back blows. First, deliver five back blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.
	• Give 5 abdominal thrusts (also known as Heimlich maneuver) :
		⁃ Stand behind the person. Wrap your arms around the waist. Tip the person forward slightly.
		⁃ Make a fist with one hand. Position it slightly above the person's navel.
		⁃ Grasp the fist with the other hand. Press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust — as if trying to lift the person up
	• Alternate between 5 blows and 5 thrusts until the blockage is dislodged.

If you're the only rescuer, perform back blows and abdominal thrusts before calling 911 or your local emergency number for help. If another person is available, have that person call for help while you perform first aid.
If the person becomes unconscious, perform standard CPR with chest compressions and rescue breaths.
If you’re alone and choking:
CALL 911
	•  Place a fist slightly above your navel.
	• Grasp your fist with the other hand and bend over a hard surface — a countertop or chair will do.
	• Shove your fist inward and upward.
	
To clear the airway of a pregnant woman or obese person:
	• Position your hands a little bit higher than with a normal Heimlich maneuver, at the base of the breastbone, just above the joining of the lowest ribs.
	• Proceed as with the Heimlich maneuver, pressing hard into the chest, with a quick thrust.
	• Repeat until the food or other blockage is dislodged or the person becomes unconscious.
