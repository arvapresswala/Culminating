Hypothermia 

Symptoms
	▪	Shivering, which may stop as hypothermia progresses (shivering is actually a good sign that a person's heat regulation systems are still active. )
	▪	Slow, shallow breathing
	▪	Confusion and memory loss.
	▪	Drowsiness or exhaustion
	▪	Slurred or mumbled speech
	▪	Loss of coordination, fumbling hands, stumbling steps
	▪	A slow, weak pulse
	▪	In severe hypothermia, a person may be unconscious without obvious signs of breathing or a pulse.

Hypothermia symptoms for infants include:
	•	Cold-to-touch, bright red skin
	•	Unusually low energy
Treatements
	•	Remove any wet clothes, hats, gloves, shoes, and socks.
	•	Protect the person against wind, drafts, and further heat loss with warm, dry clothes and blankets.
	•	Move gently to a warm, dry shelter as soon as possible.
	•	Begin rewarming the person with extra clothing. Use warm blankets. Other helpful items for warming are: an electric blanket to the torso area and hot packs and heating pad on the torso, armpits, neck, and groin; however, these can cause burns to the skin. Use your own body heat if nothing else is available.
	•	Take the person's temperature if a thermometer is available.
	•	Offer warm liquids, but avoid alcohol and caffeine, which speed up heat loss. Don't try to give fluids to an unconscious person.
