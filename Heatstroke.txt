Treatment
CALL 911
	•	Fan air over the patient while wetting his or her skin with water from a sponge or garden hose.
	•	Apply ice packs to the patient's armpits, groin, neck, and back. Because these areas are rich with blood vessels close to the skin,
	 cooling them may reduce body temperature.
	•	Immerse the patient in a shower or tub of cool water.
	•	If the person is young and heathy and suffered heat stroke while exercising vigorously -- what’s known as exertional heat stroke --
	 you can use an ice bath to help cool the body.
