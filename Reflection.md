# Reflection

My initial plan was to have a search system which worked well, looked for the symptoms and displayed the a text file. But, because I was behind on time I couldn't add all the features I wanted to. For example, when I search a symptom, and its in two files the same amount of times the app doesnt work. Also, I had hoped to add more files and a more detailed list of symptoms. I was successful in making a sorting algoritm that displays the file which has the symptoms in them as well as the design I made in the background using recursion. I had to overcome a lot of difficulties while making this project. Firstly, I had to over come the sorting algorithm. I am still new to sorting and it's been especially difficult to figure out how to use it in the way I wanted to. Also recursion has always been extrememly hard for me, but I am pretty satisfied with the way it turned out. To improve my work I would first make the searching algorithm more accurate. Also, I would improve my use of object and think of a more creative way of using it.
